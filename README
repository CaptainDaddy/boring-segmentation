boring-segmentation

This project isn't very useful, and I've put it on the back burner for this reason.  The idea behind this project
is that once a video has been split into bitmaps then those bitmaps could be segmented and then the segments could
be analyzed for similarities.  I began this as a prelude to cooler compression algorithms for my senior design course.
It almost works except there is some weird thing going on with the way the .head file gets written that screws up the
way that it would reconstruct the bmp.  I'm working on the split_space_dedup project which will be a complete video
compression suite now, and so am about to delete this repository.  The only reason that I would not would be to figure
out the bug in the file I/O.

Stay tuned for much cooler stuff.
