This is a stupid project, because it won't accomplish much.  However it is
a good exercise in debugging and cursing.  That said, I wish to take video
files, strip the audio and turn the frames into bitmaps.  Then I'm going 
to segment the bitmaps and look for similarities.  I'm working on a much
better scheme, which will be in the split_space repo or a similarly named
one soon.

the lib folder contains some mathematics and debugging fucntionality.

This project is not yet operational but should be in a day or so.
